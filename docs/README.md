# Documentation

To start contributing to the [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) documentation, you will need the [.NET Core SDK](https://dot.net) 5.0.202 or higher (as defined in the repository root `global.json` file).

## Running Preview Site

The documentation site uses [Statiq](https://statiq.dev), a static site generator. To build the documentation site run the following in a command-line terminal.

```
> Preview.ps1
```

After the build is complete, you can navigate to [http://localhost:5080](http://localhost:5080).

## Npm

The site uses some tools from the JavaScript ecosystem including npm. While Statiq will execute `npm install` and other commands as needed, you need to have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) before running a site build.

## Editing Content

The documentation is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Markdown files can be found under the following directories:

- [/input](./input)
- [/appendix](./input/appendix)
    
## Editing Layout

Layout and styling can also be found in the [input](./input) directory. Look for Sass, Css, and Images under the [assets](./input/assets) directory.
    
## Custom Build Features

The documentation site has custom enhancements to Statiq located under the [./src](./src) directory.
