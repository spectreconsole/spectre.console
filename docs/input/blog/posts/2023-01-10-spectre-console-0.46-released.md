Happy new year! ðŸŽ‰  
Version 0.46 of Spectre.Console has been released!

A lot has happened since the last release, but the most notable additions 
and changes are support for [.NET 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7/), 
the new [Layout](https://spectreconsole.net/widgets/layout) widget, and 
[rendering of JSON](https://spectreconsole.net/widgets/json). There has also been a lot of long overdue work
on the command line argument parser.
