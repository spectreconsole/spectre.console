Version 0.44 of Spectre.Console has been released!

There are a lot of fixes and improvements in this release, but the most noteworthy 
additions are better exception rendering, support for alternate screen buffers, 
and a new widget called [TextPath](xref:T:Spectre.Console.TextPath), which makes 
it easy to render paths in the console.

Check out the two new examples in our GitHub repository:

* [./examples/Console/Paths](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/blob/main/examples/Console/Paths/Program.cs)
