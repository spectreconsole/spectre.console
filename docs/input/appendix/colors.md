The following is a list of the standard 8-bit colors supported in terminals.

Note that the first 16 colors are generally defined by the system or your terminal software, and may not display exactly as rendered here.

## Usage

You can either use the colors in code, such as `new Style(foreground: Color.Maroon)` or
in markup text such as `AnsiConsole.Markup("[maroon on blue]Hello[/]")`.
